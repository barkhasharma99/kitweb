            Doraemon's physical appearance changed as the manga progressed. At first, he was predominantly kingfish
            colour, with a red tail, a white stomach, and flesh-coloured hands and feet. He also stooped, and had a body
            much larger than his head. In later issues, he sported a smaller body, white hands and feet, and a red tail
            — the appearance most identify him with today. In "The Doraemons" story arc (and the 2112: The Birth of
            Doraemon short film), it is revealed that Doraemon's original paint color was yellow. After getting his ears
            gnawed off by a robot mouse at the 22nd century Nobi's residence, he slipped into depression on top of a
            tower, where he erroneously drank a potion labeled "sadness". As he wept, the yellow color washed off and
            his voice changed due to the potion. As a result, he developed a morbid fear of mice despite being a robotic
            cat. Doraemon often becomes enraged when he is mistaken for a raccoon dog due to his missing ears, which is
            a running gag in the series.
